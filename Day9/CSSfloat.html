  <p>
    This is a paragraph of text placed next to an image. The image is floated
    to the left, so the text naturally wraps around it instead of starting
    below it. This behavior is exactly why float was invented — not for grids,
    not for columns, but for wrapping content like in newspapers.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is another paragraph to prove the point further. As long as the image
    remains floated, all inline content will flow around it.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    This block element also respects the float and avoids overlapping.
